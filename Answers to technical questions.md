Certainly! Here are answers to your questions:

### 1) Coding Test Duration and Improvement

Response:
I spent approximately 5 hours on the coding test. If I had more time, I would focus on several enhancements:

- **Error Handling:** Implement more detailed error handling and logging to capture issues during file uploads, such as permission errors or unexpected exceptions.
- **Security Measures:** Add security features like validating file contents to prevent malicious uploads and implementing CSRF protection.
- **User Feedback:** Implement a user-friendly interface to provide real-time feedback during the upload process, such as progress bars or success/error notifications.
- **Database Integration:** Create a more robust database schema to handle multiple images per entry, including metadata like upload timestamps, and user IDs, and ensure proper relationships are established.
- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to ensure the functionality works as expected and to prevent future regressions.

### 2) Tracking Down Performance Issues in Production

Response:
To track down performance issues in production, I would take the following steps:

1. **Monitoring Tools:** Use monitoring tools (like New Relic, Datadog, or built-in server monitoring) to gather performance metrics and identify bottlenecks.
2. **Logs Analysis:** Review application logs for error messages or long-running queries that might indicate a problem.
3. **Profiling:** Utilize profiling tools to analyze resource usage, including CPU and memory consumption, to pinpoint inefficiencies.
4. **Database Queries:** Examine slow database queries using tools like the query log or performance insights available in the database management system.
5. **Load Testing:** Conduct load testing to simulate high traffic and identify thresholds where performance degrades.

Yes, I have had to address performance issues in production before. In one instance, I identified a slow-running query that was causing significant latency. By optimizing the query and adding indexes to the database, I was able to improve the response time significantly.
